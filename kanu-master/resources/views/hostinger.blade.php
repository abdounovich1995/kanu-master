        The first thing to do is to listen carefully to what the customers have to say, I must put myself in their places because they need to feel like a I am on their side and that I empathize with the situation. 
        I let them finish then I start asking the right questions to Identify the problem and analyze it. 
        After that I develop multiple solutions and I don't stop at the first one. It may be good, but much better ones may exist.
        The final step consists on choosing the optimal solution and start solving the problem or find someone who can solve it and quickly.

        I remember when I was a member of the BECLUB, the scientific club of our university, which was composed of 10 founding members and many active members.
        We organized many national events and competitions, we worked together since it was an idea until we realized it on the ground, we worked hard in all circumstances, meeting almost daily at the same table to discuss ideas and work with principle of brainstorming.
        The school honored us for what we achieved together. It was an unforgettable experience for me and I have built strong and long-lasting relationships with everyone I work with .

        for  me , customer success is  ensuring that every customer receives the  maximum value from the product or service.
         This includes advising them on buying decisions and onboarding new users after purchase. 
         they  have an in-depth understanding of the customer's needs and are responsible for communicating 
         common customer behaviors to the sales, marketing, and product teams.
         as a result of that we maximize retention, preventing churn, and ensuring customer happiness.

        “Hm, that’s a good question. Let me think about it,”


        One day I got a call from one of my clients, he works as a barber. I made an app for him that let their clients booking appointments through Messenger Chatbot.
        He was so angry and he was shouting why the bot stopped, people can't book an appointment anymore 
        What happened?
        I let him finish. I apologized to him and told him tell me more, what exactly is the problem?
        He told me that when customers clicked on confirmation of reservations, they would receive an error message with a three-digit code
        I told him not to worry. The solution is very simple. Just send me a screenshot and I will solve the problem now.
        He did what I asked of him and I found that Facebook made some updates and removed some features.
        And they were sending me alerts on my Facebook developer account, but I was busy doing the exams.
        I solved the problem and I apologized to him again, I told him that the app was just missing some update and he understood the situation.
         I learned from this experience that I have to stay up-to-date with updates and the latest news. No matter the app is in good condition, it is subject to a bug at any time.
